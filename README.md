<!-- Updated Portfolio -->

I initially created this website using mostly Bootstrap elements with no CSS. As I've grown a bit I have become more comfortable with additional elements which I have incorporated in this Updated Profile.

First I updated the main page which is the Contact page, this gives a person the option to input their contact informaton with an optional message for future discussions. 
<!-- Add Local Storage -->

Through this Contact page a person has the opportunity to visit my personal profile which includes a picture of myself and a short bio. There are also several images that will be submitted in the future. You can be directed to these pages by clicking the Portfolio and About Me at the top of the page.

This website is not yet completed but please feel free to watch my journey.
